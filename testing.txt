Testing Questions:

a) Test a real world object
	1. Who will use it and why?
	2. What are the use cases?
	3. What are the limits of user?
	4. What are the stress and failure conditions?
	5. How would I perform the testing?

b) Test a piece of software

	3. What are the use cases?
	4. What are the limits of use?
	5. What are the stress and failure conditions?
	6. What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?
	
c) Write test code for a function
	Validating input and output
	1. Define the test cases
	2. Define the expected result
	3. Write the test code

d) Troubleshoot an existing issue
	1. Understand the scenario
	2. Break down the problem (Follow step by step to see if issue is reproducible)
	3. Create specific, manageable tasks.  Give customers steps to troubleshoot

-------------------------

	- Assure there are no typos and gramar is correct
	
	SOCIAL
	- Check Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin functionality

-----------------	
Test Google Spreadsheets:

	-

	Formatting
	- Bold, italics, underline
	
	Edit
	- Search and Replace
	
	File Save
	- Auto Save
	- Save in the cloud
	
	Ecosystem
	- How it works with Gmail attachments

How to test a pen:
	1. Who will use it and why? What kind of pen is it? (fountain, ballpoint, rollerball, etc)
		Kids and teens at school
		
		
		
	2. what are the use cases? Is intended for paper or other surfaces?
		Users should be able to write 1,500 pages with one pen
		Can you write smoothly on paper
		
	3. what are the limits of use
		After 1,500 pages the pen should not work anymore
		
	4. What are the stress and failure conditions
		The pen can open and close 10 times per minute for a day
		
	5. what are the testing scenarios

-----------------------------
How to test a paper clip:

	1. Who will use it and why?
		By teachers to hold papers together
			- Hold 10, 15, 20 pieces of paper together
			- Using paper used by students at school
			- Hold single pieces of paper vs. paper with staples
	2. What are the use cases?
			- Assure paper clip does not damage the paper
	3. What are the limits of use?
		Hold 30 to fifty pieces of paper with minimal bending
		It should work in the temperature range between 35 to 100 degrees Farenheit
			- Test with the limit number of pages
			- Test in the within the temperature limit
	4. What are the stress / failure conditions
		What is acceptable before product fails
			- After 30 pages it is ok if the paper clip is bended
			- Test at the limit of 30 pages several times.  Paper clip should show limited binding
	5. How would you perform the testing
		Can I do some automation

---------------------------------		
How would you test a wash machine
	3. Stress
		30 to 40 pieces of clothing should not cause fire
		
----------------------------		
How would you test a chair?							
	5. How would you perform the test
		A chair should last for 5 years
			Automated test to get to the number of sittings in five years.
			
------------------------------			
Manual vs Automated testing:
	1. There may be some things that humans are better for testing.  For example, whether
	the content of video is adequate for kids.
	
Blackbox vs. white box testing:
	1. Whitebox testing tester has access to the code, while in black box testing the tester
	is giving a box and the fucntions from a user perspective.
	
---------------------------------	
How will you test parental controls	on a web browser
	1. Black box vs. White box
		White box for this exetcise	
	2. Who will use it and why
		Parents and kids.  Parents will control what kids can watch on the Internet
	3. What are the use cases
		- Installing the software
		- Updating controls
		- removing controls
		- Parents Internet usage
		- For children accessing allowed and blocked content
	4. What are the limits of use
		- What does it mean for a web site to be blocked?
		- Should it be the entire website or just a web page?
		- Is the application supposed to learn what is acceptable?
	5. What are the stress conditions and failure conditions?
		- The software should not crash the computer
		- The software should not ban an allowed site
		- The software should not permit a banned site
	6. What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?
		Divide the problem into categories:
		a) Installation
			Installation on MACs, Windows, Tablets or SmartPhones
			RPM vs ova deployment
		b) Updating controls
			GUI Interface to add controls			
		c) Removing controls
			GUI interface to remove controls
		d) Blocked or allowed sites		
			Using a list of allowed sites, Can you browse them?
			Using a list of blocked sites, Are they banned?
----------------------------

How would you test sort(int[] array), which sorts an array of integers:

How long can the array be?
is sorting ascending or descending

odd and even number of entries in the array


1. Positive test cases
	1. 3, 2 ,1 
	2.  -1, 0, -5, 2
2. Negative test cases
what happens if a float is given as input
what happens if we go over the integer limit
what happens if a string is giving as one of the array values					
What happens if an empty array is given?
What happens if there are duplicates in the input?
What happens if there is only one input in the array?
What happens if the array is already sorted? or sorted in reverse order?

Troubleshooting

Google Chrome Crash
1. What operating system they were using
2. Can they provide logs when the event happens
3. What were they users doing during the crash
4. What does task manager shows while the user is running the app
5. What version of the browser and OS where they using
6. How long has been this happening
